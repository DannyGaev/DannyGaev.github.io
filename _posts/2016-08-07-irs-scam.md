A friend of mine and I received a message from the IRS at nearly the same time.

I replied to them, in hopes that I would be eligible to receive slightly more than the offered amount...

but got no response. This is when I started to suspect something was off. 

When I tried opening the link on my computer, it did not work -- the page could not be found. Opening the link on both MacOS and Windows machines gave no result, either. So, either the scammers severely misconfigured their infrastructure, or there's some silliness going on here.

Looking back to the original phishing message, we can see that it *does* specify Safari as the browser of choice... interesting. Maybe the receiving server is configured only to respond to web requests incoming from Safari browsers/User Agents. I tried crafting a request that would satisfy these requirements, but after struggling for far too long, I opted to instead open the link on my phone while monitoring its traffic and webpage elements on my computer -- an incredibly deep thank you to the following sources for helping me create this Rube Goldberg-eque phish detonation setup:
