<div id="changes"></div>

You may have caught that em-dash, you'll be seeing more of them. I know it's pretentious, but I cannot let Grok takes that away from me.


<script>
    function checkCookie() {
        var title = document.getElementsByClassName("h0 py-4 mt-3");
        var div_changes = document.getElementById("changes");
        let reoffender = getCookie("reoffender");
        if (reoffender != "") {
            title[0].innerHTML = "Welcome back!";
            div_changes.innerHTML = "It's nice to see you again -- feel free to skip the rest here, it's the same as last time."
        }
        else {
            document.cookie = "reoffender=true";
            title[0].innerHTML = "Hello There!";
            div_changes.innerHTML = "I've noticed it's your first time here -- welcome!"

        }
    }
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
        checkCookie();
    });

</script>
