You may have caught that em-dash, you'll be seeing more of them. I know it's pretentious, but I cannot let Grok take that away from me.

My name is Daniel Gaevskiy (shortened here to Gaev for ease of pronunciation). I am a Computer Science-turned-Cybersecurity student, 
soon to have graduated from university. On this website you can find some of the <a href="https://dannygaev.com/projects/">Projects</a> I've completed, Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges
I've solved and felt proud enough to <a href="https://dannygaev.com/writeups/">Write-Up</a>, and a look at the <a href="https://dannygaev.com/competitions/">Competitions</a> I've completed and how I approach them.
